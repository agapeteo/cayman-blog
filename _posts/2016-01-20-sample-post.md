This is what a post on your blog looks like. This template is especially well suited for posting nice succint blurbs, much like [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) does. Of course, it will also work well with longer posts, and you can change the number of posts per page in the `_config.yml` file. There's no guarentee this blog will make you write as well as he does, but it will present your writings in a beautiful, clean, and distraction-free way. Try to write a little bit, every day.
